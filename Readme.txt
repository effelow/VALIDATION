This is one of my student assignments within the course CIS270 Client-side Web Programming taught by Dr. Wyatt.

The project is called VALIDATION. The main task of this assignment was to create a HTML form for tax calculation, validate the input and do the calculation with javascript.

Additional assessment criteria was to make the form as user-friendly as possible. So the user should not be notified when entering the information in the wrong way. 

Instead of alerts which can be really annoying when interacting with a website I implemented a way such that the user gets informed by notes, hints and tips next that show up next to the input box it relates to.
